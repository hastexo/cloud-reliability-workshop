What is OpenStack?


Open-source
## cloud platform
[ASL 2.0](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)

Note: The Apache Software License is a "permissive" license. This
means you can do anything you like with the software, including
creating a proprietary fork, as long as you include the required
notices. This choice of license has enabled OpenStack adoption in
industries that traditionally have been very FOSS unfriendly (such as
telco).
